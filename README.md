# Prerequisites
* .NET 6.0.100 SDK or later (can be downloaded [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0))
* Visual Studio 2022 Community edition or [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) 2022.1.3 (or later) are strongly recommended.
* Visual Studio Code with the [.NET Core Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer) works too but is a bit harder to use.
